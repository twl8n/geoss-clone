      <p>Created by Jodi Kanter, Tom Laudeman.<br>
        University of Virginia<br>
        December 9, 2002<br>
        <br>
        Currently both MAS (Affymetrix MicroArray Suite) and dchip data files 
        can be loaded into the GEOSS version 1 database. There are three separate 
        spots tables into which the derived values are loaded: "am_spots_mas5," 
        "am_spots_mas4," and "am_spots_dchip." All other table modifications are 
        consistent among all three types of data.<br>
        <br>
        The MAS data files are loaded in Excel format:<br>
        <br>
        1. Open a .chp file from within the MAS software program.<br>
        <br>
        2. Click on the "options" button located on the toolbar at the top of 
        the page. On the "metrics" tab make sure the "save all metrics results" 
        box is checked and the "save each analysis to a separate file" is selected.<br>
        <br>
        3. Do a FILE, SAVE AS and change the "save as type" at the bottom of the 
        dialog box to Excel file. <br>
        <br>
        ** IMPORTANT NOTE: The script used to be set up to load excel files created 
        where the option setting was "Save Analysis Setting." This was changed 
        as the first two columns were found not to be useful. However the script 
        still anticipates that a particular heading will exist in the Excel File. 
        Make sure the following exists on line 16 of the file, following the header:<br>
        <br>
        Expression Analysis: Metrics Tab<br>
        <br>
        Insert this into line 16 and add a blank row. This string above must exist 
        on line 16 and the data must begin on line 19 (column titles in row 18) 
        for the data to load correctly, otherwise you risk missing some data in 
        the load.<br>
        <br>
        ** We are hoping to correct this script by the end of July 2002. Once 
        corrected, the script will no longer rely on this manual entry and will 
        also support the upload of MAS 4.0 data.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Loading the Data File.<br>
        <br>
        Loading MAS 5.0 Data<br>
        <br>
        MAS 5.0 data (and very soon MAS 4.0 data) are loaded by the curators from 
        the curator's web page. The data must be present in a predetermined location 
        in either Excel or tab separated text format. All of the Affymetrix files 
        must be present as well. For each completed hybridization, there will 
        be a &quot;Load &lt;order number&gt;&quot; button on the curator's web 
        page.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Loading DChip Data.<br>
        <br>
        To load the dchip data use the loadchip_spots.pl. The command and procedure 
        is similar to that stated above for the MAS data. The spots data will 
        be loaded to the am_spots_dchip table.<br>
        <br>
        <font size="-2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">$ loaddchip_spots.pl 
        --am_pk=123 --dbname=geoss /PATH/file_name.xls</font></p>
