      </b> 
      <p> You can expect to spend some time installing a GEOSS development environment. 
        In a best case scenario, where all the dependencies have been installed, 
        you could potentially install GEOSS in about an hour. However, if you 
        also need to install and configure Apache, Postgres, and R, you should 
        plan several days for the install.</p>
      To start developing on GEOSS:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Get developer access to the project on SourceForge. This is necessary 
          only if you will be checking changes into the GEOSS code base. To get 
          access you must first create an account at <a href="http://sourceforge.net"> 
          Source Forge</a>. Then you need to contact <a href="mailto:twl8n@virginia.edu"> 
          Tom Laudeman</a> to get added to the SourceForge project.</li>
        <li> Perform all steps of an install as described in the installation guide, 
          until you reach the "Install GEOSS" stage. If there are multiple installations 
          of GEOSS on the machine, make sure to choose a different database name 
          and user than the default ("geoss"). Also, make sure none of your install 
          paths conflict with other installations. </li>
        <li> If you will be checking changes into SourceForge, you will need to 
          get the code from the repository. Otherwise you can install from the 
          tarball as described in the Install Guide.</li>
        <li> <b> cd geoss </b></li>
        <li> Copy build.options-default to build-options.mk</li>
        <li> If you are the only user with GEOSS installed on this system, and 
          you have root access, the default options are fine. If not, you will 
          need to set these appropriate according to where you have write access, 
          how your files will be served, and how you will be connecting to the 
          database. If you will be installing in your public_html directory, see 
          sample options in <a href="./install_guide.html#__BODY3.2.4"> Section 
          3.2.4 of the Install Guide</a>.</li>
        <li> <b>make all</b> </li>
        <li> <b> cd &lt;BIN_DIR&gt; </b>(as set in your build-options.mk) </li>
        <li> <b>./geoss_initialize --db_name=&lt;your db&gt; --db_user=&lt;your 
          db user&gt; </b></li>
        <li> Finish configuration as described in the Install Guide </li>

          <p> <b><a name="__BODY2.3">2.3</a>&nbsp;GEOSS Directory Structure</b><br>
            The GEOSS directory structure attempts to group files together logically 
            by function. Sibling subdirectories of the top directory can have 
            different build/install rules, but subdirectories of each sibling 
            should have the same rules as their parent. Where I use CAPS (except 
            for the product name) , I am describing a value that is set in build-options.mk 
            prior to building the system. 
          <ul>
            <li><i>geoss:<br>
              </i> This is the top level directory. It contains files pertaining 
              to building GEOSS, and the license file. Try not to clutter up this 
              directory. </li>
            <li><i>geoss/bin:<br>
              </i> This directory contains scripts that are intended to be run 
              by GEOSS administrators from the command line, and scripts that 
              are intended for use by other command line scripts. Scripts in this 
              directory are intended to be installed in a directory in the user's 
              path, so we have tried to prefix these scripts with geoss_. Files 
              in this directory are installed into the BIN_DIR directory. If a 
              script is intended for use via the web interface, but not the command-line, 
              then put it in the appropriate subdirectory of site, not in bin. 
            </li>
            <li><i>geoss/database:<br>
              </i> This directory contains files for defining and initializing 
              the database. It is not anticipated that developers should need 
              to add files to this directory. Changes to geoss_schema.in should 
              be coordinated with <a href="mailto:jkanter@virginia.edu">Jodi Kanter</a>. 
              The files in this directory are used by geoss_initialize and thus 
              need to be installed. They are installed in WEB_DIR/database. </li>
            <li><i>geoss/devtools:<br>
              </i> This directory contains scripts and files that are useful to 
              developers but are not necessary for installing GEOSS. Examples 
              include the spec file for building the rpm and a script that searches 
              through our directory tree substituting one string with another. 
              Files in this directory should be code or pseudo-code and are not 
              installed. </li>
            <li><i>geoss/doc:<br>
              </i> This directory contains documentation files that don't need 
              to be released to end users. This includes our test document and 
              coding guidelines. New developers should review the contents of 
              this directory. Files in this directory should be text files and 
              are not installed. </li>
            <li><i>geoss/lib:<br>
              </i> This directory contains files that have collections of functions 
              for use by multiple files. Files in this directory are installed 
              into the LIB_DIR directory. </li>
            <li><i>geoss/site:<br>
              </i> 
              <p>This directory contains scripts and pages associated the parts 
                of the GEOSS product that can be accessed without logging in. 
                These include the main project page and a publicly accessible 
                documentation pages. Files in site and its subdirectories will 
                be accessible via the web interface. To that end, they will be 
                in the WEB_USER group and are installed in WEB_DIR.</p>
              <p> Files that are in subdirectories of site are all built and installed 
                in the same fashion. They are separated into directories by project 
                component in order to keep directory sizes reasonable and make 
                things easy to find. </p>
            </li>
            <li><i>geoss/site/admintools:<br>

              use. These pages comprise the "Admin Home" component of the project. 
            </li>
            <li><i>geoss/site/graphics:<br>
              </i> This directory contains all graphics files for the site. </li>
            <li><i>geoss/site/public_data:<br>
              </i> This directory contains pages associated with the display of 
              public data. </li>

              </i> This directory contains pages associated with general use for 
              users who are logged in. These pages comprise the "Member Home" 
              component of the project. </li>
            <li><i>geoss/site/webtools/analysis:<br>
              </i> This directory and its subdirectories contain the code for

          <p> <b><a name="__BODY2.4">2.4</a>&nbsp;GEOSS Make System</b><br>
          <p>Conceptually there are two parts to "making" a file in the GEOSS 
            system. The first phase is the "build", the second is the "install". 
            The "build" stage does nothing to non-executable files like graphic 
            files or html files. Executable files, which currently include files 
            that have a .pl source file, are copied to a new file (typically a 
            .cgi, with the exception of files in the lib and bin dir) that contains 
            some global variables and has the executable bit set. Also, a syntax 
            check (perl -c) is performed on the resulting file. The second phase, 
            the "install" phase, installs all files, both executable and non-executable 
            into the appropriate directories. Different make targets are discussed 
            below:</p>
          <b>How To Use The Makefiles:</b><br>
          <ul>
            <li><b>make all</b> 
              <p> This command makes the entire system by performing a make directories, 
                a make build, and a make install. </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>make install</b><br>
              <p> This command will install the target files (EXEC_TARGETS and 
                NONEXEC_TARGETS) in the current directory and below into their 
                install directory. </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>make directories</b> 
              <p> This command must be issued from the top level directory. It 
                makes the USER_DATA_DIR directory, the WEB_DIR directory, and 
                the public_data directory with appropriate permissions and ownership. 
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>make build</b> 
              <p> This command makes all EXEC_TARGETS in the current directory 
                and below. It will perform a syntax check on the EXEC_TARGETS. 
                The build target is the default target, so if no target is specified, 
                a make build is performed. </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>make <target_file></b> 
              <p> This command can be used to build and target .cgi file (note 
                that it also performs a syntax check on the file). It does not 
                install the target file. </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>make uninstall</b> 
              <p> This command removes files from the install directories. Essentially, 
                it reverses the actions of the make install target. </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>make rmdirectories</b> 
              <p> This command must be issued from the top level directory. It 
                removes the directories created by a make directories (if the 
                directories are empty). </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>make unall</b> 
              <p> This command must be issued from the top level directory. It 
                performs a make uninstall and a make rmdirectories. </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>make clean</b> 
              <p> This command will remove EXEC_TARGETS. Essentially, it cleans 
                up after a make build by removing the .cgi files that are created 
                during a make build. </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <b>Adding Files</b><br>
          <p>If you add a file, it needs to be added to the Makefile (in the same 
            directory that you have added the file in). If the file is not executable, 
            like a graphic or an html file, it should be added to the list of 
            NONEXEC_TARGETS. If it is an executable file, like a .pl, it should 
            be added to the list of EXEC_TARGETS.</p>
          <b>Removing Files</b><br>
          <p>If you remove a file, it should be removed from the Makefile.</p>
          <b>Adding Subdirectories</b><br>
          <p>If you add a subdirectory, it needs to be added to the Makefile (in 
            the same directory that you have added the file in). It should be 
            added to the SUBDIRS line.</p>
          <b>Removing Subdirectories</b><br>
          <p>If you remove a subdirectory, it should be removed from the SUBDIRS 
            line in the Makefile (in the parent directory of the subdirectory).</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>GEOSS Makefiles Explained:</b><br>
          There are three special files in the geoss directory that are used by 
          the make process. They are: 
          <ul>
            <li><i> build-options.mk</i><br>
              This file contains build parameters. They are set to build-options.default 
              for the rpm build, but can be customized for users who build their 
              own system from source. These define what directories the files 
              are placed into, who owns the files, and what database GEOSS will 
              connect to. </li>
            <li><i> subdirs.mk</i><br>
              This file defines targets that should be available no matter what 
              directory the developer is performing a make in (like "install" 
              and "clean"). This file is intended to be included by all GEOSS 
              makefiles. </li>
            <li><i> rules.mk</i><br>
              This file contains build rules for building .pl files (to .cgi and 
              to no extension) and the rule for building the perl-header file. 
              It is intended to be included by all GEOSS makefiles. </li>
          </ul>
          <p> The GEOSS Makefiles were redesigned when we decided to build rpms 
            to facilitate the install process. Many of the redesign decisions were 
            based on making a build sequence that worked well with rpm. Several 
            other decisions were based on common design principles and on knowledge 
            of issues with our previous make sequence. The following paragraphs 
            outline these principles, so that developers can adhere to them. They 
            should be reviewed if you are altering or modifying the makefiles 
            in a significant way, but it is not necessary to review them if you 
            aren't changing the makefile structure.</p>
          The GEOSS Makefiles have been defined to adhere to the following principles: 
          <ul>
            <li>Make syntax should be portable<br>
              Where possible, we have tried to use syntax that will work with 
              all versions of make. The exception to this is the "X : X" style 
              rules in rules.mk, which are gnu-specific. These were implemented 
              this way due to time constraints, and will need to be modified if 
              the product is ported to a different make implementation. However, 
              we would like to move towards generic syntax, so keep code portable 
              where possible. </li>
            <li>The build process should follow the standard compile/install sequence.<br>
              Our build procedure has two phases, a "compile" phase and an "install" 
              phase. Strictly speaking, "compile" is a misnomer as we are using 
              perl scripts, which don't need to be compiled. In our product, the 
              compile phase parses global variables into the the input scripts, 
              and performs a syntax check. The "install" phase copies the "compiled" 
              files to the appropriate directories and sets permissions. Technically, 
              we could have done both the install and compile in one step, but 
              it works better to have two separate steps for several reasons. 
              Primarily, it fits very nicely into the desired sequence for building 
              rpms. It also is useful if there are people (other than you) using 
              the system you are working on: the two step sequence prevents you 
              from installing a file with a syntax error that could interrupt 
              the user using the system (doesn't help with logical errors, of 
              course, but at least we've addressed one level). Finally, it is 
              useful to have a sequence that mimics a standard build procedure 
              as it should be easier for new developers to understand. </li>
            <li>Each Makefile should be similar in structure and design to the 
              other GEOSS Makefiles<br>
              With all the build rules and targets extracted into rules.mk and 
              subdirs.mk, the Makefile in each directory essentially includes 
              a list of files in that directory that should be built/installed. 
              The similar format of all Makefiles makes it easy to write scripts 
              to change all of them (should changes to their format be required), 
              rather than having to modify each of them on an individual basis.</li>
            <li>Common elements should be extracted from individual Makefiles 
              into one file and that file should be included<br>
              This is just a basic coding principal--reuse is good. Therefore, 
              rather than add something to every makefile, add it to rules.mk 
              or subdirs.mk. </li>
            <li>Creating links are avoided<br>
              Links are problematic when building rpms--particularly when you 
              want to make a relocatable rpm (which we do). Thus, we have eliminated 
              links from GEOSS. </li>
            <li>Build parameters are provided to the scripts by parsing them into 
              the script files<br>
              This is probably the least elegant part of the GEOSS make. The developer 
              sets their build parameters in build-options.mk (or they can be 
              overridden as command-line parameters to make). These parameters 
              are used by the Makefiles in determining where to put files. So 
              far so good. However, our perl scripts need to know where those 
              files have been put. To that end, make creates a file called "perl-header" 
              that is added onto each perl file. There is, of course, a bit of 
              wasted space/processing time in this approach, but that is largely 
              negligible. The nasty part is that when you add/remove/modify a 
              build parameter, you must change it in the build-options.mk and 
              the rules.mk file. The nice aspect of this approach is that it does 
              not involve links (bad for rpm). Potentially, we could have put 
              these values in a single file, and included it in all scripts. However, 
              the directories that scripts are put in is variable and would have 
              needed to be determined on the fly. This would also have required 
              parsing all the scripts to set the correct relative path and would 
              have had the extra complication of determining the relative path. 
              A variation on this is to include multiple copies of the build parameters 
              file, one in each directory. This removed the issue of determining 
              the relative path and parsing the files, but introduces new issues. 
              This approach introduces the potential for copies of the file to 
              get out of sync, and requires careful attention to be paid to setting 
              up dependencies so all copies of the files are updated if the base 
              file changes. Thus, we decided to go with the approach that prepends 
              the values into each file. It is robust, conceptually simple, and 
              easy-to-implement. </li>

          </b> 
          <p> The best reference I found for building an rpm was "Maximum RPM" 
            by Edward Bailey. It is very complete and largely accurate. Check 
            there if you have questions. </p>
          <p> As for building the GEOSS rpm, here are the main steps: 
          <ul>
            <li> Create a place to build the rpm. It is best not to build the 
              rpm as root, so you need to mimic the root rpm-building directory 
              structure. 
              <ul>
                <b> 
                <li> cd </li>

                <li> mkdir .rpm/SPECS </li>
                <li> mkdir .rpm/BUILD </li>
                <li> mkdir .rpm/RPMS </li>
                <li> mkdir .rpm/SRPMS </li>
                <li> mkdir .rpm/RPMS/i386 </li>
                </b> 
              </ul>
              You are now have a build structure.</li>
             <br>
            <li>Next, you need to correctly tag the version and get an appropriate copy of the code:
              <ul>
                 <li><b>cd ~/geoss</b></li>
                 <li>cvs up -d</li>
                 <li>modify build-options.default to the new version number</li>
                 <li><b>cd devtools</b></li>
                 <li><b>cp geoss-X.X.spec geoss-X.Y.Z.spec</b></li>
                 <li>modify geoss-X.Y.Z.spec to have new version number</li>
                 <li><b>cp geoss-X.Y.Z.spec ~/.rpm/SPECS</b></li>
                 <li><b>cd ..</li>
                 <li>cvs commit -m "Updated version numbers"</li>
                 <li>cvs tag Test-X_Y_Z</b> (use Rel-X_Y_Z for release, Test-X_Y_Z for Test candidates)</li>
                 <li><b>cd ..</li>
                 <li>cvs export -r Test-X_Y_Z -d geoss-X.Y.Z geoss</b></li>
              </ul></li>
            <li> You now have a good copy of the source, ready for building an rpm. To do this:<br>
              <ul>
                <b> 
                <li>cd geoss-X.Y.Z</li>
                <li>cp build-options.default build-options.mk</li>
                <li>cd ..</li>
                <li>tar cvf geoss-X.Y.Z.tar geoss-X.Y.Z</li>
                <li>gzip geoss-X.Y.Ztar</li>
                </b> 
              </ul>
            <li><b>cp geoss-X.Y.Z.tar.gz .rpm/SOURCES</b></li>
            <li> <b> cd .rpm/SPECS</b></li>
            <li> Build the rpm:<br>
              <b>rpmbuild -ba --buildroot /home/&lt;yourid&gt;/buildroot geoss-X.Y.Z.spec 
              </b></li>
          </ul>
          <p> The resulting rpm, assuming everything went well, is in .rpm/RPM/i386. 
            Note that this is the simplified version of building an rpm, which 
            assumes that we don't need to apply any patches to get the system 
            to build (which we currently don't). </p>
          <p> The code in the tarfile needs to be in the geoss-X.X directory, 
            so I currently copy the contents of my checkout to a directory of 
            that name before tarring it up. </p>
          <p> Also, when making an official release of an rpm, it is important 
            to increment the version numbers (as described in "Maximum RPM"). 
          <p> 
          <p> We don't currently sign our rpm, but hopefully we'll do that in 
            the future. </p>

Where should I look for error messages and debugging statements?
</b>
<p>
There are several areas where a developer may find error messages.  Each 
is described below:
<ul>
<li><i>/var/log/httpd/error_log</i></li>
<p> If you get an "Internal Server Error" message in your browser, and you
are using http to communicate, you should find more information about your
error here.  Additionally, this log will contain messages written to STDERR.</p>
<li><i>/var/log/httpd/ssl_error_log</i></li>
<p> If you get an "Internal Server Error" message in your browser, and you
are using https to communicate, you should find more information about your
error here.  Additionally, this log will contain messages written to STDERR.</p>
<li><i>$USER_DATA_DIR/<userid>/error.txt</i></li>
<p>Non-fatal errors and debugging messages are written to these files on a 
per-user basis.  You can write to this file using the "write_log" 
function.</p>
<li><i>$USER_DATA_DIR/<userid>/child_error.txt</i></li>
<p>
Occasionally, like when an analysis is running, a process will be forked, 
and a child process executes.  If that code contains write_log statements,
they will be written to child_error.txt.
</p>

              How should I read in html files?  
</b>
<p>
  The get_allhtml, readfile and readtemplate functions are found in
 geoss_session_lib.pl.  They are used to read in an html file.  Typically
some variable substitution is executed on the html file, and then the page
is ready to be displayed.  All three functions expect an input html file.  
Optionally, a header html file and footer file can be specified, and 
their contents will be prepended/appended to the specified html file.  The 
header and footer file we use contains the GEOSS logo and navigation bar.  
</p>
<p>
The readfile function essentially returns the html string of 
header + input file + footer.  No variable substitutions are made and it 
is the programmer's responsibility to ensure that the html string is 
appropriate for display.
</p><p>
The get_allhtml file expects extra parameters: the database handle, the 
user key, and a hash reference.  It uses this information to perform
substitutions for the programmer.  Theoretically, it returns a display
ready html string.  The hash reference should contain all values necessary 
for substitution into the htmlfile (usually you will need to specify 
"htmltitle" and "htmldescription" at the very least).  The function will 
determine configuration variables necessary for substitution by using the 
supplied database handle.  This function can be used if there is no
loop in the input html file.
</p><p>
The read_template function is intended for use when there is one or two
loops in the input html file.  A loop is delimited in the html file by 
&lt;loop&gt;.  A loop within a loop would be delimited by &lt;loop2&gt;.
The programmer manually substitutes in loop data by copying the returned 
loop template and substituting in values.  If you use readtemplate, you 
will also need to manually substitute all non-loop variables.
