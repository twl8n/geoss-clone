    You cannot load studies with different chip types if all your study
    data is in a single input file (this is logical as rows are named
    for probe set ids specific to individual chips).  You can configure
    a study with different chip types (on a per sample basis) via the
    GUI and array center staff can load such a study.  It may be possible
    to bulk load studies with different chip types using the data
    directory option, although this functionality has not been tested.
