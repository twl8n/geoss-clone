    You must have the "txt" file.  The "rpt" file is recommended as it 
    is used to error check against the <link linkend="layout">layout</link>
    of the chip type specified for the 
    <link linkend="hybridization">hybridization</link>.

    <para>
    Other files are not mandatory.  Some provide quality control data.  All 
    other files, if loaded, will be made available to <link linkend="users">
    users</link> for download.  Additionally, if the user <link 
    linkend="publishing_your_data">publishes their data</link> these files
    will be made available to the public.
