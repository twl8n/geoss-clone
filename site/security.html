      <p><b> GEOSS Security System.</b> 
      <p>Tom Laudeman, Jodi Kanter </p>
      <p> GEOSS has row level security implemented in Perl and supported by 
        4 tables within the database. Some tables, especially the chip data tables 
        are secured indirectly since these tables can only be accessed via keys 
        found in directly secured tables. There is an assumption here that the 
        server running GEOSS is secure and has logins only from admins, and 
        that the database is not accessible outside the GEOSS scripts, or to 
        other servers. Http requests for data must be SSL encrypted. If a database 
        server is used, local packets must not be allowed outside a secure subnet.</p>
      <p>This 4 table security model is based on extensive discussions with Hilmar 
        Lapp and Jason Stewart. (It is actually a 6 table model since it include 
        the contact table, and we added primary investigator capability.)</p>
      <p><b>Salient points about the Security model.</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>There are two aspects to security: web interface, and database records.</li>
        <li>Web security is currently based on Apache htaccess authentication 
          and SSL. Future versions will use a database and CGI based 'true' security 
          model.</li>
        <li>GEOSS has row-level security for the database tables. The row level 
          security is implemented in standard SQL, and is supported by a Perl 
          API.</li>
        <li>The security model has users, groups, and primary investigators. PIs 
          are simply users distinguished by having them self as a PI. In a practical 
          sense, GEOSS only allows PIs to own data.</li>
        <li>GEOSS has a full set of permissions, however, not all are used. 
          User permissions are controlled by the software, and indirectly by the 
          curators. Group permissions are under the user's control as usual. World 
          or 'other' permissions are not used. Execute and suid permissions are 
          not used.</li>
        <li>Users may create their own groups, and control the group membership.</li>
        <li>There isn't really a 'super-user'. In cases where the security system 
          needs to perform some super user action, the underlying Perl code simply 
          doesn't use the security API calls.</li>
        <li>Security system permissions, etc. can be manipulated from the Postgres 
          command line (psql). For this and other reasons, only sysadmins are 
          allowed logins to the GEOSS server. Curators are generally not sysadmins. 
          (Data curation is the responsibility of the microarray center personnel.)</li>
        <li>Database security tables are only joined to the rest of the GEOSS 
          schema via a foreign key linked to the primary key of each secured table.</li>
        <li>The security system foreign key occurs in the groupref table of the 
          security system.</li>
        <li>Some tables are secured 'directly'. These tables share a foreign key 
          with the groupref table in the security system.</li>
        <li>Other tables are secured 'indirectly'. There is no access to these 
          tables except via foreign keys from a directly secured table. </li>
        <li>A prime example of 'direct' is the arraymeasurement table (hybridization 
          information) </li>
        <li>A prime example 'indirect' is the am_spots_mas5 table which contains 
          the signal data. </li>
        <li>Information in arraymeasurement must be accessed in order to get signal 
          data from am_spots_mas5. Records in am_spots_mas5 are meaningless unless 
          you have the data from arraymeasurement.</li>
        <li>Selecting records from a given table with read or write permissions 
          requires a SQL query with eight clauses. This doesn't create a bottleneck 
          because the directly secured tables have small numbers of records. For 
          instance, the arraymeasurement table has one record per gene chip. Contrast 
          this with the am_spots_mas5 table that has 12,625 records for each HG95AV2 
          gene chip.</li>
        <li>All directly secured tables share a single sequence for their primary 
          key. This guarantees that any directly secured table's foreign key in 
          the groupref table is unique. Since there are 2 raised to the 32 power 
          available numbers in this set, we don't anticipate running out of primary 
          key values.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><b>Overview.</b></p>
      <p>This document assumes that the reader has working familiarity with databases 
        and operating system security models.</p>
      <p>Please note that we distinguish between two major types of data: meta 
        data (usually just called 'data') and chip/array derived values referred 
        to as 'chip data'. 'Chip data' is indirectly secured, and the reasons 
        and methodologies are explained in detail below.</p>
      <p>We chose a security system with the following criteria:</p>
      <p>- minimal impact on the GEOSS schema</p>
      <p>- row level granularity</p>
      <p>- Unix-like permissions for user (owner) and group</p>
      <p>- included some type of sessioning for use with a Web interface</p>
      <p>When a user creates a new record (by creating a new study, or adding 
        an experimental condition, etc.) the new record is owned by the current 
        user's primary investigator (PI). New records created have group read/write 
        access by default. Group read and write are optional and are controlled 
        by the owner (the PI). In many cases, the member of a research team who 
        performs the wet bench work also interacts with GEOSS to create studies, 
        experimental conditions, and to request orders and fill out orders. The 
        PI may only be involved when the gene chip data is ready. In a small lab, 
        the PI often does everything. GEOSS has been designed to accommodate 
        team members in any role.</p>
      <p>Since the security tables are independent of the GEOSS data tables, 
        the security system can be modified with little or no impact on the rest 
        of GEOSS.</p>
      <p>The 4 main security system tables are: groupref, grouplink, groupsec, 
        usersec. The 2 ancillary tables are: contact, pi_sec. Contact contains 
        personal information, and a pi_sec contains PI information. Neither of 
        these two latter tables are central players in the security system. </p>
      <p>The only requirement of a secured data table is that it shares a special 
        sequence to generate primary keys (the sequence is called pk_seq). The 
        data table's primary key is the foreign key which links the security system 
        to the data table rows. For example, when inserting a record into the 
        study table, the new study record's primary key is the next value from 
        pk_sec, and that same primary key is the linking value in groupref. We 
        know the ownership and permissions of the study record by linking to the 
        corresponding groupref record.</p>
      <p>Usersec and groupsec contain information about a user and that user's 
        group. These two tables share a primary key, and this same primary key 
        is used by the GEOSS contact table. The numeric uid and gid are in 
        usersec and groupsec, respectively. </p>
      <p>Grouplink has a one to many relationship with groupsec. Group member's 
        gids are stored in grouplink, thus grouplink contains the members of each 
        of the groups.</p>
      <p>Groupref is the real heart of the security system. The primary key of 
        a secured row of a data table is a foreign key in groupref. Table groupref 
        also contains the uid of the owner, the gid of the group, and an integer 
        bitfield for the permissions. Groupref has one row for every row of data 
        directly secured in other tables. For instance, if you create a study 
        with two experimental conditions, there will be three records in directly 
        secured tables. There will be three corresponding records in groupref.</p>
      <p>This security system makes the assumption that the database is transactional. 
        Since multiple sequential operations are required to insert data, each 
        transaction must be atomic, or race conditions would result in corrupting 
        the primary keys used to link the data to the security tables.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><b>Details of Read Permissions.</b></p>
      <p>The following Perl string is a SQL <font face="times"><b>WHERE</b> clause 
        used to determine if a user has read permission to a given row. In this 
        string, $table is the name of the secured table, $pkey is the name of 
        that table's primary key, and $userid is the security system usersec primary 
        key (uid and gid) of the user REMOTE_USER.</font></p>
      <p>(groupref.ref_fk=$table.$pkey and</p>
      <p> ((grouplink.us_fk=$userid and<br>
        groupref.us_fk=grouplink.us_fk and<br>
        grouplink.gs_fk=groupref.gs_fk and<br>
        (groupref.permissions&amp;256)&gt;0) or </p>
      <p> (groupref.gs_fk=grouplink.gs_fk and<br>
        grouplink.us_fk=$userid and<br>
        (groupref.permissions&amp;32)&gt;0 )))</p>
      <p>The first stanza joins groupref to a data table $table with primary key 
        field $pkey.</p>
      <p>The second stanza checks to see if the owner of the record has read permissions 
        (decimal 256 is octal 400).</p>
      <p>The third stanza check to see if the group has read permissions (decimal 
        32 is octal 40).</p>
      <p>The API assumes that the programmer will call the functions appropriately. 
        In other words, the programmer will call <font face="Courier">read_where_clause() 
        when selecting data for read, and <font face="Courier">write_where_clause()</font> 
        when updating a record.</font></p>
      <p><b>Details of Write Permissions.</b></p>
      <p>(groupref.ref_fk=$table.$pkey and</p>
      <p> ((groupref.us_fk=$userid and<br>
        groupref.us_fk=grouplink.us_fk and<br>
        grouplink.gs_fk=groupref.gs_fk and<br>
        (groupref.permissions&amp;128)&gt;0) or</p>
      <p> (groupref.gs_fk=grouplink.gs_fk and<br>
        grouplink.us_fk=$userid and<br>
        (groupref.permissions&amp;16)&gt;0 )))</p>
      <p>Once again, the first stanza joins groupref to a data table $table with 
        primary key field $pkey.</p>
      <p>The second stanza checks to see if the owner of the record has write 
        permissions (decimal 128 is octal 200).</p>
      <p>The third stanza checks to see if the group has write permissions (decimal 
        16 is octal 20).</p>
      <p>In both the read and the write cases, only tables which contain meta 
        data are secured. The actual data (usually signal values) can only be 
        accessed after getting foreign keys from a directly secured table. The 
        meta data tables (such as exp_condition and arraymeasurement) are fairly 
        small, so even a complex query will run quickly. The many thousands of 
        records for the actual chip data are referenced via foreign keys obtained 
        from meta data tables. Thus the final query which retrieves data is small 
        and efficient.</p>
      <p><b>Advantages of the 4 Table System.</b></p>
      <p>From a programming standpoint, this system simplifies interaction between 
        the security tables and the rest of GEOSS . GEOSS data tables have 
        no security-related information in them. The only requirement for a table 
        to be directly secured is that it use the unified primary key sequence 
        ( pk_seq ). </p>
      <p>Inserting a new record is a two step process which is completed in a 
        single transaction (and must be a transaction to avoid trouble). First 
        the data row is inserted; the primary key is auto assigned, and and the 
        sequence auto incremented (this is typical behavior for Postgres). Second, 
        the security API is called, and retrieves the most recent primary key, 
        and creates a record in groupref with the most recent primary key as the 
        foreign key (groupref.ref_fk). Having completed both of these steps, the 
        transaction can be committed.</p>
      <p>The security system doesn't know what table is being secured, it only 
        tracks the primary key. Retrieving data involves joining the data table 
        to groupref and grouplink.</p>
      <p>Updates are performed in the usual manner. The security system involvement 
        in an update happens prior to the update where the API is used to verify 
        that the record about to be updated is allowed.</p>
      <p>Reading records requires that any <font face="times"><b>SELECT</b> use 
        the additional <b>FROM</b> and <b>WHERE</b> clauses supplied by <font face="Courier">read_where_clause</font>().</font></p>
      <p>The 4 table system has another theoretical advantage. More complex security 
        criteria can be implemented by updating the Perl code, and by adding fields 
        to the 4 security tables. This would have no effect on the rest of the 
        GEOSS schema. Since the schema is complex, and the amount of data (especially 
        chip data) can be immense, it is a big advantage to not change the GEOSS 
        data tables when the security system gets new features.</p>
      <p>The 4 table system has enough tables that it is possible to implement 
        ACLs with only an additional field or two. ACLs are nice for their increased 
        granularity and flexibility, however, the price is complexity for end 
        users and admins.</p>
      <p>One aspect of this system is that it is not encapsulated by the database 
        manager (Postgres) at a low level. Rogue scripts can easily ignore the 
        security system. This is yet another reason why we limit command line 
        access (and IP connections to the Postgres port) on the GEOSS server.</p>
      <p>Many thanks to Hilmar Lapp and Jason Stewart. It took several days of 
        exchanged messages to work out the details of Hilmar's suggestion to use 
        4 tables and to use the single primary key sequence. I did not immediately 
        see the elegance of this solution (nor did I initially understand some 
        key concepts) so I'm thankful for Hilmar and Jason's patience. Jason's 
        wisdom and advice have been instrumental in our progress on GEOSS.</p>
