      <p>The web interface consists of a number of html pages and Perl scripts 
        that work together to allow investigators and curators to document their 
        work, to upload data files, and to perform analyses of data. <br>
        <br>
      <p align="left">The first figure show how samples and data progress through 
        GEOSS. All of the activities above the dotted line are performed by researchers. 
        Below the dotted line is a simplified diagram of work flow within the 
        microarray center. <br>
        <br>
        The staff of the microarray center has a special curator-only area in 
        GEOSS. The staff is small in number, and they are personally trained by 
        the GEOSS administrators, so we won't cover their user interface.

        <img src="graphics/overview.jpg" width="541" height="323" border="1"><br>

      <p>Researchers main activities are: 
      <ol>
        <li> creating studies 
        <li> generating orders 
        <li>analyzing data 
      </ol>
      <p><br>
        For the purposes of GEOSS, a "study" is a set of related experimental 
        conditions. An experimental condition is any distinct set of treatments/protocols 
        which are used to subset data during analysis. <br>
        <br>
        Orders are generated to request hybridizing samples to gene chips. The 
        researcher describes the samples in the GEOSS system, and then delivers 
        the samples to the microarray center. Hybridizations are requested on 
        a per-sample basis. Each sample can have multiple hybridizations, and 
        a specific gene chip layout (set of probes) can be selected for each hybridization. 
        We have assumed the use of Affymetrix chips, where there are only a small 
        number of chips layouts, each with a known fixed set of probes. <br>
        <br>
        The personnel in the microarray center will verify the completeness of 
        the order, perform the hybridization and subsequent raw data analysis, 
        and then load the data into GEOSS. <br>
        <br>
        The second figure describes the work flow followed by investigators as 
        they create studies and orders.. </p>
