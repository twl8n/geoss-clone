      </b> Graphical administration tools are available for GEOSS and can be accessed 
      via the "Admin Home" page. When an administrator logs in, they are immediately 
      taken to Admin Home. The majoirty of administrative tasks can be accomplished 
      from this location, but there are also command line scripts for most tasks 
      to facilitate scripting of administration tasks.<br>

        </li>
        The installation information link provides details about the GEOSS installation 
        on your system. This page is strictly informative in nature and may be 
        used to diagnose installation difficulties. It reports the build parameters 
        of the system, the installed versions of required software, whether the 
        permissions on essential directories are correct, the currently loaded 
        layouts, and the currently loaded analyses. <br>

          <p><b><a name="__BODY1.2">1.2 Configure GEOSS</a></b></p>
        </li>
        The "Configure GEOSS" page may be used to set the runtime configuration 
        variables for your GEOSS implementation. This should be done directly 
        after an installation. You may occasionally wish to update parameters, 
        but they should only require seldom changes (if ever) after installation. 
        A brief description of each parameter follows:<br>
        <ul>
          <p> 
          <li><i>WWW Host</i>:&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the FQDN of the server that 
            GEOSS is installed on.</li>
          <p></p>
          <p> 
          <li><i>Additional Path Information</i>:&nbsp;&nbsp;
            If you did not set your DocumentRoot to /var/www/html/geoss/site, you will need to enter additional path information.  That path information should contain the path from HTML_DIR to the site directory.  For instance, if your DocumentRoot is /var/www/html, you would set your additional path information to /geoss/site.</li>
          <p></p>
          <p> 
          <li><i>Organization Name</i>:&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the name of the organization 
            installing the GEOSS system. This value is used for display purposes 
            only.</li>
          <p></p>
          <p> 
          <li><i>Curator Email</i>:&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the email address for the 
            curator who should receive GEOSS mail, such as requests for order 
            creation.</li>
          <p></p>
          <p> 
          <li><i>Public Data Admin Email</i>:&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the email address 
            of the user who will receive requests to publish data. Users can request 
            that their data be published, but for security reasons, the request 
            needs to be reviewed. The Public Data Admin receives those requests, 
            reviews them, then confirms that data should be published. </li>
          <p></p>
          <p> 
          <li><i>Administrator Email</i>:&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the email address 
            of the administrator who installs and maintains GEOSS. GEOSS provides 
            this address for those who have questions about the installation. 
          </li>
          <p></p>
          <p> 
          <li><i>Alternate Curator Email</i>:&nbsp;&nbsp; This contains the email 
            addresses of additional users who need to review order requests. </li>
          <p></p>
          <p> 
          <li><i>Chip Data Path</i>:&nbsp;&nbsp; This specifies the location of 
            chip data files. When the curator attempts to load data, the system 
            will look for the data files in this location. The user running the 
            web server needs to have read permission on this directory. </li>
          <p></p>
          <p> 
          <li><i>General Inactivity Logout</i>:&nbsp;&nbsp; This specifies the 
            number of inactive minutes before a general (non-curator) user is 
            automatically logged out. </li>
          <p></p>
          <p> 
          <li><i>Curator Inactivity Logout</i>:&nbsp;&nbsp; This specifies the 
            number of inactive minutes before a curator user is automatically 
            logged out.</li>
          <p></p>
          <p> 
          <li><i>Administrator Inactivity Logout</i>:&nbsp;&nbsp; This specifies 
            the number of inactive minutes before an administrator user is automatically 
            logged out.</li>
          <p></p>
          <p> 
          <li><i>Add curators to all groups by default</i>:&nbsp;&nbsp; If selected, 
            this will cause new curators to be added to all groups when the curator 
            user is added. Additionally, when new groups are added, existing curators 
            will automatically be added to the group.<br>
            This feature is not fully implemented and will be completed in the 
            next release.<br>
          </li>
          <p></p>
          <p> 
          <li><i>Bug Report Url</i>:&nbsp;&nbsp; This URL specifies a link that 
            users can use to report bugs. It defaults to the GEOSS development 
            team's installment of bugzilla and shouldn't be changed unless you 
            wish to track bugs separately on your installation.</li>
          <p></p>
          <p> 
          <li><i>Header/Footer Link Text</i>:&nbsp;&nbsp; Each installation has 
            the ability to add a custom link to the navigational controls. This 
            is the text that will be displayed for that link. </li>
          <p></p>
          <p> 
          <li><i>Header/Footer Link Url</i>:&nbsp;&nbsp; Each installation has 
            the ability to add a custom link to the navigational controls. This 
            is the url of the link. </li>
          <p></p>
          <p> 
          <li><i>Custom Home Page Description</i>:&nbsp;&nbsp; Each installation has 
            the ability to add a custom home page description.  This description will appear on the site home page prior to the generic GEOSS description. </li>
          <p></p>
          <p> 
          <li><i>Custom News Item #1 & #2</i>:&nbsp;&nbsp; Each installation
            can configure custom "news items" that can be used to inform users of periodic events such as training sessions or GEOSS related publications or activities. </li>

          There are currently four supported user types: administrator, curator, 
          public, and experiment_set_provider. 
          <ul>
 <li><i>Public User:</i><br>
 Public Users can use GEOSS to analyze data using analysis trees.  Data can be uploaded or extracted from publicly available data sets.  Data files, including analysis results can be shared with other users.  Accounts are free, but users must provide a valid email address.  Once you request an account, your login information will be mailed to the specified email address.</li>
 <li><i>Member Users:</i><br>
Member Users can use GEOSS to define studies and place orders with the array center.  Once an order is processed, the data is loaded into GEOSS.  From there, member users can download or analyze their data.  Results may be shared with other users.  Additionally, all chip data and analyses results will be backed up and secured.  In order to get a member user account, your identity must be verified.  You will need to fill out detailed contact information so a GEOSS administrator can contact you.</li>
 <li><i>Array Center Staff Users:</i><br>
Array Center Staff Users are responsible for fulfilling GEOSS orders.  They perform gene chip experiments and load resulting data.  These accounts are only available to staff.</li>
 <li><i>Administrator:</i><br>
Administrators can configure GEOSS and perform all operations necessary to maintain a GEOSS installation.  This includes managing users, layouts, analyses, and MIAME data.  These accounts are only available to GEOSS staff.</li>

          be successfully run from the command line. Current analyses are written 
          in Perl and R. If the output from one analysis can be used as input

          Currently available analyses are loaded by the installation scripts, 
          so you shouldn't need to load new analyses unless you write your own. 
          Analyses are loaded via the <a href="#__BODY2.4">geoss_add_analysis</a> 
          command.<br>

          Once a researcher has published their experiment results, they may wish 
          to make the data available to the public. To do this, they enter relevant 
          MIAME information about the experiment and then request that it is published. 
          It is then available to all web users by clicking on the "View Public 
          Data" link from the site home page. <br>

            </b></li>
          Data is not instantly available when a user submits it for publication. 
          An administrator needs to verify that the information should be published. 
          This is because it may not be the principal investigator (the owner 
          of the data) who chooses to publish it. In that case, the PI is emailed 
          by GEOSS, informing them that their data is about to be published. If 
          they do not wish it to be published, they can contact the administrator 
          who can prevent the publication of the data. <br>

          Currently the public data admin receives an email describing the steps 
          to make data public. We hope to have a link to do make data public available 
          in Admin Home in the next release.<br>

            </b></li>
          If data is published that you wish to remove from the site, it can be 
          removed by removing the appropriate files from the public data directory. 
          To determine the public data directory, check the "GEOSS Install Information" 
          link from "Admin Home". Public data is in USER_DATA_DIR/public_data. 
          You will need to find the directory named after the PI of the data you 
          wish to remove. If the PI has only published one set of data, you may 
          remove the entire directory. If the PI has published more than one set 
          of data, you will need to remove the appropriate files from inside the 
          directory. The set of files should include an indexrec file, an zip 
          files of all, cel, chp, and exp data. The filenames will include the 
          miame name of the data.<br>
          <br>
          Again, we hope to create a link from "Admin Home" to do this if future 
          development time permits.<br>
