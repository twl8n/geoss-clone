      <p><b>Introduction: </b> The GEOSS project is a rewrite of the original 
        GeneX 1.4 which was initially conceived at NCGR as a proprietary software 
        project. Along with two other projects, GEOSS has emerged from this earliest 
        version as a direct result of diverging requirements and a need for a 
        practical and functional system. GEOSS is open source and freely available 
        at the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a> web site.
      <p> The evolution of GEOSS continues to be driven by the need to get the 
        greatest use of gene expression data. Developers at the University of 
        Virginia, through modification and innovation, have created a secure, 
        web based relational database management system that allows users to load, 
        archive, manage and analyze gene expression data. 
      <p>GEOSS includes: <br>
        1) A convenient user interface based on the workflow of biomedical microarray 
        research. Investigators login via a web browser to enter a variety of 
        general and MIAME required information pertaining to their studies, experimental 
        conditions, samples and hybridizations. 
      <p>The array center has been supplied with a number of online processing 
        tools which allow them to track and bill for orders, create reports, and 
        manage work load. Special center support is included so the array center 
        can adjust their order approval and billing practices according to each 
        center's individual requirements. 
      <p>2) A web tool that allows each user to post his array data for public 
        access. Public data can be viewed and downloaded from the main GEOSS web 
        site without a user account. It can also be analyzed via the GEOSS set 
        of analysis tools by simply creating a public access account. In addition, 
        personal data can be analzyed once uploaded to the GEOSS system. 
      <p>3) An innovative Analysis Tree interface that can interactively incorporate 
        different analytical tools into a unified analysis tree. GEOSS is a database 
        combined with an integrated toolset to enable researchers to analyze their 
        data, and in some circumstances to make a comparative reference to public 
        data. Text delimited data sets can be uploaded, regardless of technology, 
        to be analyzed. <br>
<p>        The current analysis tools include a) up-to-date statistical methods for 
        discovering differential expression patterns in microarray data: t-test, 
        SAM, permutation test, and LPE (Local Pooled Error) test, especially the 
        last recommended for small-sample (less than six replicated arrays per 
        condtion) microarray data analysis, b) statistical and functional filtering, 
        c) annotation tool which can provide many different types of annotational 
        and functional information, and d) hierarchical clustering tool which 
        provides both cluster-image-map and direct links to NCBI genome information 
        sites for each microarray data set analyzed.
