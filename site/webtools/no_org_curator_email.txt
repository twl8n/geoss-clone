Subject: Incorrect GEOSS organization configuration

Array order {oi_pk} was just submitted for approval.  It is part of 
organization {org_name} (org_fk).   This organization requires array 
orders to be approved, but no organization administrator has been configured.

The order has been automatically approved and forward to the array center
staff.  However, the configuration should be fixed so that there is a 
organization administrator or so that orders do not require approval.
