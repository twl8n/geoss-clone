<!--MIAME_NAME_POPUP-->
<a name="miame_name_popup"><b>Miame Name</b>
This is the name that your publishing information is stored under.  It
should correspond to one experiment.
</a><br><br>

<!--MIAME_DESCRIPTION_POPUP-->
<a name="miame_description_popup"><b>Miame Description</b>
This description should summarize important information (like species and intent
 of experiment) about the study you are publishing.  The description will appear
 in a summary table of all published experiments.
</a><br><br>

<!--ASSOCIATED_STUDY_POPUP-->
<a name="associated_study_popup"><b>Associated Study</b>
If your study is tracked in the local GEOSS system, select it from the list.
This allows the system to fill in some of the Miame data for you.  You
can modify all the values that the systems sets.

<!--ED_TYPE_POPUP-->
<a name="ed_type"><b>Type of experiment</b>
For example, is it a comparison of normal vs. diseased
tissue, a time course, or designed to study the effects of a gene knockout?
</a><br><br>

<!--ED_DESIGN_POPUP-->
<a name="ed_design"><b>Hybridizations design:</b>
A description of the comparisons made in each hybridization, whether to a
standard reference sample, or between experimental samples.  
</a><br><br>

<!--ED_FACTORS_POPUP-->
<a name="ed_factors"><b>Experimental factors</b>
The parameters or conditions tested, such as time, dose, or genetic
variation.
</a><br><br>

<!--ED_QC_STEPS_POPUP-->
<a name="ed_qc_steps"><b>Quality control steps taken:</b>
For example, replicates or dye swaps.
</a><br><br>

<!--ED_URLS_POPUP-->
<a name="ed_urls"><b>URLs of supplemental websites:</b>
Should include any supplemental websites or database accession numbers.
</a><br><br>

<!--SMP_ORIGIN_POPUP-->
<a name="smp_origin"><b>Origin of the biological sample and its
characteristics</b>
Origin of the biological sample should include the name of the organism and
the provider of the sample.  Characteristics might include things like
gender, age, developmental stage, strain, or disease state.
</a><br><br>

<!--SMP_MANIPULATION_POPUP-->
<a name="smp_manipulation">
<b>Manipulation of the samples and the protocols used:</b>
For example, growth conditions, treatments, separation techniques.

<!--SMP_LABELING_POPUP-->
<a name="smp_labeling">
<b>Protocols for preparing the hybridization and labeling extracts:</b>
For example, the RNA or DNA extraction and purification protocol.
</a><br><br>

<!--AD_DESIGN_POPUP-->
<a name="ad_design">
<b>General array design:</b>
Should include platform type (whether the array is a spotted glass array, an
<i>in situ</i> synthesized array, etc.); surface and coating ad_specs (when
known--often commercial suppliers do not provide this data); and the
availability of the array (the name or make of commercially available
arrays).
</a><br><br>

<!--AD_REPORTER_TYPE_POPUP-->
<a name="ad_reporter_type">
<b>Type and unambiguous identifying information of each reporter:</b>
Type should be cDNA or oligonucleotide.  Information characterizing the 
reporter molecule might include appropriate database reference(s) and 
sequence (if available).
