<p><b>Description</b><br>
The addLinks module allows users to add html links to their output.  The
links take the user to the appropriate information for each gene at the NCBI
site.  This linking is similar to the links created by the treedraw analysis,
but addLinks can be applied to the output of many modules.  Options all the links to be placed at the front or back of the output
file.  The output file can be in either html or txt format.

  <b>Input files</b><br>
Add links expects input in this form:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li> a file containing a column labeled "Probe.Set" that contains the gene
accession number.<br>
    <br>
</ul>
    Analyses that create input in this format include:<br>
<ul>
  <li>qualityControl<br>
  <li>diffDiscover<br>
  <li>filter<br>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Output files</b><br>
  AddLinks creates the following output:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li> A html or txt file that contains the columns of the input file, plus a
column of linking gene accession numbers to the associate NCBI information.
    <br>
</ul>
    Analyses that accept AddLinks output as input include:<br>
<ul>
  <li>none<br>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Parameters:</b><br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Log filename - name of the file containing log and error messages<br>
  <li> Output filename - name of the file containing new links<br>
  <li> Output type - specifies whether the output file should be html or txt
format<br>
  <li> Add NCBI link - currently this is the only type of link to add.  If
this option is not checked, your output file would look exactly like your
input file.  Eventually, we hope to add links to other sites.<br>
  <li> Placement of links - whether to place the new information as the first
column of the file or as the last<br>
</ul>
