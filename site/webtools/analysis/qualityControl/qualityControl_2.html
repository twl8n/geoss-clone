<p><b>Description</b><br>
The quality of the results of an analysis depend on the quality of the input
data.  The "Quality Control" (QC) module produces some indicators of the
quality of data. They are:<br>
<li>Scatter plot of data from chips within the same condition, the replicates,
along with the scatter plot of data from chips of different conditions. The
assumption is that the data by replicate chips should look much more similar
than the data by chips from different conditions. If data from two chips are
very similar, the data points should concentrate along the 45-degree line in
the scatter plot. The more the points are scattered away from the 45-degree
line, the less similar the chips are.<br> 
<li>Specificity and sensitivity. Specificity, or reproducibility, is
average correlation between replicated arrays within each condition.
Sensitivity is difference between specificity and average correlation between
non-replicated arrays.<br>
The QC module performs normalization of data.  It then writes the normalized
data into the disk for later use by other GEOSS modules.  It also has an
option for 'lowess' normalization of data.  This type of normalization may be
required once the scatter plots show a curvature.  Version 2 uses R 2.1, while Version 1 uses R 1.9.

<b>Statistical Methods</b><br>
The following computations are done on the inputted data:
<li>Removes Affymetrix control probe sets.<br>
<li>Normalizes the data by adjusting the inter-quartile range (IQR) of each
chip to equal the maximum IQR, and the medians to the maximum median across
all chips.  To adjust the IQRs, it computes the ratio of IQR of each chip to
the maximum IQR of all the chips.  It then divides the chip values by this
ratio.  For the medians it computes the difference between maximum median of
all the chips with each chip, then subtracts the chip values.<br>
<li> Optionally does a lowess normalization.  Using the first chip as
reference, it fits a lowess curve to scatter plot of first chip against the
next chip, then computes the deviation from the 45-degree line, and subtracts
it from the second chip.  This process is repeated for each chip.<br>
<li>A thresholding at 1 is done.
<li>For plotting and for computing the specificity and sensitivity, a
log-base-2 transformation is done.

  <b>Input files</b><br>
Quality Control expects input in this form:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li> A file containing chip data. The file should have row and column labels.<br>
</ul>
Analyses that create input in this format include:<br>
<ul>
  <li> File extract (analysis version)<br>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Output files</b><br>
  Quality Control creates the following output:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li> A data file containing normalized data
  <li> Scatter plots of data
  <li> Text file stating specificity and sensitivity <br>
</ul>
 Analyses that accept quality control output as input include:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Differential Discovery<br>
  <li>Multi-condition Differential Discovery<br>
  <li>Add Links<br>
 </ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Parameters:</b><br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Type of graphical output - specifies the type of output for graphical data 
    (pdf or jpg). It you want data suitable for publishing, choose 'pdf'. The 
    jpg format uses less space but the quality is not as good.<br>

   <li> Perform lowess normalization - performs LOWESS normalization in addition to the default IQR normalization. <br>

</ul>
