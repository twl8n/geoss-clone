<p><b>Description</b><br>
The cluster analysis performs hierarchical clustering analysis for
microarray data (it is recommended to apply this module for an array data
set with less than 2,000 genes for optimal performance).  One can choose
different combinations of one of the distance metrics (e.g., Euclidean,
Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation) and one of clustering
algorithms (e.g., "single", "complete", "average").<br>
</p>
Cluster then draws the hierarchical clustering tree and
corresponding image maps (cluster-image map; CIM) from the output of a
hierarchical clustering algorithm.  This will generate a high-density pdf
graphic, which is zoomable by utilizing Adobe Acrobat reader.  The gene names
and annotations at the end of the tree branches are hyperlinked to genome web
sites.<br>
Cluster version 2 is run using R 2.1.  Cluster version 1 is run using R 1.9.

  <b>Input files</b><br>
Cluster expects input in this form:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li> A file containing an analysis criteria.  The file should have row and
column labels. Note that we won't process more than 7000 rows.<br>
    <br>
</ul>
Analyses that create input in this format include:<br>
<ul>
  <li> Filter <br>
  <li> Differential Discovery (likely too many rows - run through filter first) <br>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Output files</b><br>
  Cluster creates the following output:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li> A file containing data necessary to draw a graph
  <li> A file containing user data
  <li> A file containing stat data
  <li> A pdf file showing a cluster tree
    <br>
</ul>
    Analyses that accept cluster output as input include:<br>
<ul>
  <li>None<br>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Parameters:</b><br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Graphical output filename - name of the file containing the tree<br>
  <li> Zoom factor - zoom increases "magnification" of the tree but not the
colorized expression map<br>
  <li> Need of log 2 transformation - log2-transformation is taken typically and the previous modules provide raw data, 
  so this should be set to 'True', unless log2-transformation is taken elsewhere.<br>
  <li> Euclidean distance measure - the distance/dissimilarity metric. <br>
	"Euclidean" - Euclidean distance<br>
	"Correlation" - Pearson correlation<br>
	"Spearman correlation" - Spearman rank correlation<br>
  <li> Clustering algorithm  <br>
	"average"  - average distance<br>
	"complete" - maximum distance or farthest neighbor <br>
	"single"   - minimum distance or nearest neighbor<br>
  <li> Log filename - name of the file containing log and error messages<br>
  <li> Statistical graph, user, Tstat output filenames are obsolete <br>
</ul>
