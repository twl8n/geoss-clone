<p><b>Description</b><br>
The module 'Filter' allows one to triage genes for further analysis, such as
clustering and functional analysis, based on a combination of several statistical criteria. 
In addition, genes related to some key words can be selected based on gene symbol, gene name, and gene ontology (GO) databases.
This module also allows one to add annotations such gene symbol, gene names, unigene ID, locus ID, chromosome location, and GO information.
The order of conditions can be changed in this module.

<b>Input files</b><br>
  Filter expects input in this form:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li> A file containing differential discovery results. The file should have row and column labels.<br>
    <br>
</ul>
Analyses that create input in this format include:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Differential Discovery<br>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Output files</b><br>
  Filter creates the following output:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li> A filtered intermediate data file containing a subset of input rows
  <li> A filtered output file containing a subset of input rows and statistics
</ul>
Analyses that accept filter output as input include:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Cluster<br>
  <li>Add Links<br>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Parameters:</b><br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Two conditions to compare: vector levels of two conditions for comparison<br>
  <li> First Filtering: choice of statistic for primary filtering<br>
  <li> Second Filtering: choice of statistic for additional filtering<br>
  <li> Cutoff values: cutoff values for filtering by the selected statistic  <br>
  <li> Functional Filtering: key words for gene symbol, gene name, or GO-based filtering<br>
  <li> Maximum number of rows to return: maximum number of genes<br>
  <li> Condition order: re-order conditions <br>
  <li> Output data filename: name of the data file with all data and statistics<br>
  <li> Intermediate data filename: name of the data file to pass to other analysis nodes<br>
  <li> Log filename: name of the file containing log and error messages<br>
</ul>
<p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Note:</b><br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li> If no statistics are selected in 'Filter', the LPE z-statistic will be used to select the maximum number of genes.  <br>
  <li> If a statistic that was not computed in 'Differential Discovery is selected in 'Filter', 
the LPE z-statistic will be used to select the maximum number of genes.
  <li>  If there are no replicates for a condition, the LogFC will be used to select the maximum number of genes.
  <li> If 1900 genes are kept, the files generated with 'Cluster' will not be viewable with Acrobat Reader. <br>
</ul>
