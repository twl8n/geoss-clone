This document describes the use and purpose of the Organization portion of the GEOSS system from the organization curator perspectives.  </p> 
<p>An "Organization Curator" acts as the administrator to all relevant data
pertaining to their associated organization. They will be in charge of adding
and removing users as well as authorizing orders which are placed under the
ownership of that organization.</p>

<p><a name="__BODY1.0">1.0</a>&nbsp;Organization Home: The Curator's Administration Tool</p></b>

Administration tools are available to each organization curator via their
"Org Home" page. When a user who is a curator of a particular organization
logs in they will be taken to their Org Home page. They will also be provided 
with a link to their Org Home which can be found in the page header. If they 
are curators of more than one organization then each link on the Org Home page 
will allow them to choose which organization they are administering at that moment. <br>

	<a name="__BODY1.1">1.1 Approve Orders</a></b>
	
	The approve orders link allows a curator to see a list of all orders
	which are currently assigned to their organization. This list includes
	orders awaiting approval as well as those recently approved. Future
	system enhancements will include an archive of older approved orders.
	Once approved the orders are marked as complete and ready for
	processing by the array lab.  <br>
