This document outlines the proposed stradegy for upgrading statistical analyses that are part of the genex-va system.

1. Overview
Genex-Va provides users with statistical analyses modules that can be used to analyze data.  Naturally, we will want to update these routines from time to time.  However, if a routine has been used by a researcher to analyze their data, 
we should not modify it, as it is essential that researchers can reproduce their results.  Therefore, we should never over-write an analysis that is currently in use.

To address this, all files associated with a module will be stored in their 
own directory off the analysis subdirecotry.  For each version, there will
be a complete set of files with an _ and version number appended to the
filename (before extension). For example, the first version of a module will
contain files such as module_1.cfg and module_1.rw. The next version would
have module_2.cfg and module_2.rw.  The complete name with version number
will be displayed in the analysis selection box that researchers use to
choose an analysis.

When the system administrator does a cvs update or adds there own module,
they should do a make load_analysis to get new versions of analyses.  Note
that the system will try to reload all modules, and issue warnings about
already loaded modules.  These warnings are expected.
