Cutting a Release of GEOSS
==========================
1) Update the Version number in build-options.default and in
devtools/geoss-X.X.spec

2) Update release notes.

3) Follow steps outlined in devtools/make_rel_commands.pl

9) Upload it to Sourceforge anonymous ftp upload server. SourceForge only supports ftp, and
you must use the incoming file area. Login as anonymous, and use your
email address as the password. Use binary upload mode.

ftp upload.sourceforge.net
# login as usual for anonymous ftp
cd /incoming
bin
put geoss-X_Y_Z.tar.gz
put geoss-X_Y_Z-1.i386.rpm
put geoss_layouts.tar.gz
put geoss_perl_modules.tar
quit


10) Go to Sourceforge and login. Go to
https://sourceforge.net/projects/va-genex
(Eventually we'll move all this over to the geoss project,
but in the meantime we're still using the va-genex project for
releases).


11) In the main menu, click "Admin" which takes you to
https://sourceforge.net/project/admin/?group_id=71073 


12) In the second menu click "File Releases" which takes you to
https://sourceforge.net/project/admin/editpackages.php?group_id=71073 

Scroll down to the bottom of the page. 


13) Click "Add a Release" for the GEOSS project. 


14) The release name is human readable, use the format: GEOSS 2.1.0

Click the "Create This Release" button.


15) At the top of the page "Step 1: ..." Date, Release Name, and
"Active" status should all be correct. Scroll down to "Upload Release
Notes". Treat this field as "Brief download instructions and brief release
notes". This is NOT our release_notes.txt file. Type in some brief
notes. Include the following text changing version numbers as
appropriate:

--
To install GEOSS you must download three files.

For an rpm install the first file is: geoss-2.0-1.i386.rpm. 
For an manual install the first file is: geoss-2.0.tar.gz

Everyone must also download two additional files:
geoss_layouts.tar.gz
geoss_perl_modules.tar
--

15.1) Now do the "Upload Change Log". This is our
doc/release_notes.txt. Browse for the file as usual.

Scroll down to below the two text boxes.

Check "Preserve my pre-formatted text."

Click "Submit/Refresh".


16) In the middle of the page "Step 2: ..." click the check box next
to the files you uploaded with ftp. Be careful. It is possible to click
someone else's files. Click "Add files and/or Refresh View". Be sure
to get all three files 


17) At the bottom of the page "Step 3: ..." Filename and release
should be correct. Choose "Platform-Independent" from the processor
drop down. Choose "Source .gz" from the File Type drop down. Click
"Update/Refresh".


18) Go to the Files section of our project to verify that the new
release is available.
