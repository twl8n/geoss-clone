GEOSS Test Procedures
--------------------

The purpose of this document is to outline the tests necessary to
ensure basic functionality of the GEOSS system. Once the tests
outlined here have been performed, the system is ready for Beta
testing.

As a reminder, testers should watch /var/log/httpd/error_log and
/var/log/httpd/ssl_error_log for errors when they test.  Any error messages
should be investigated.  Our goal is to have clean error_logs.

Verify Testing Platform
-----------------------

Confirm that your testing platform is running the same software as genes by
running the following commands on genes and the test platorm:

- Note:  the geoss_versions script can be used to get most of the information
  below
- kernel info:
   uname -a
- Apache:
   /usr/sbin/httpd -v
- Postgres:
   postmaster --version
- R:
   R --version
  Within R:  library() to determine version modules in the libraries
- Document Root
   - verify same DocumentRoot value in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf   

New Functionality Tests
-----------------------
- Verify all bugs that have been fixed since the last release.  

- If new functionality areas have been introduced, verify them according to
specific plans for those areas.


Installation Tests
------------------

- Verify that the system installs cleanly when following installation
  instructions


Presentation
------------

- Check spelling of all pages
 make clean
 for a in `find . -name '*.html'`; do aspell check $a; done
 for a in `find . -name '*.xml'`; do aspell check $a; done

- Verify that all links work

- Where possible, refer to help pages while testing functionality to 
  ensure that it is accurate and helpful.


Account creation
----------------
- create an account using admintools

- create an account using the geoss_adduser command 

- Verify that /var/lib/geoss/<userid> is rwxrwx- - - and owned by
  <installer>:apache

- Verify that email gets sent to new account owner.

- Verify that the email makes sense, and that the links in the email
  body are correct.

- Verify that you cannot create an account with a duplicate userid.

- Verify that you must have a pi_login for a new account.

- Verify that the pi_login must be either a valid user, or must be the
  same new userid that you are creating.

- Verify that accounts are not created if that type of user is not allowed
  on that installation.  (Admin->Configure GEOSS->Uncheck "Allow X Users on 
  the system").  Try adding a user of that type.

- Use the request account link of the site main page to request a public
  account.  Verify that the account is created.

- Use the request account link of the site main page to request a 
  member account.  Verify that the administrator receives a new account
  request.

- Verify that if a public user does not login within "days to confirm" days, 
  their account is removed.

- Verify that the first time a user logs on, they are advised to change their 
  password.

- Verify that if a user requests an account type that is not allowed on a
  given installation, that a link is provided to a companion GEOSS system,
  if such a system exists.


Password checks
---------------

- Verify that a valid user can log on

- Verify that an invalid user cannot log on


Studies
-------

- Create a new study 

- Verify that choosing create new study gets the study creation page

- Verify that invalid study creation dates are rejected

- Verify that duplicate studies can not be created

- Verify a sanity check on the comments field

- Verify that you cannot create a study in a group that is not your own (by
  passing incorrect values through the url)

- Verify that you can modify all study fields

- Verify that fields provide sanity checking where appropriate

- Verify that you can add an experimental conditions 

- Verify that new experimental conditions use appropriate default values

- Verify that you can delete an experimental condition that has no data loaded

- Verify that you cannot delete or modify an experimental condition that has
  data loaded (you can still add new samples)

- Verify that updating experimental conditions is successful

- Verify that creating more than 10 experimental conditions doesn't
  overwrite the value of the second experimental condition.

- Verify that you can add samples

- Verify that you can delete samples that are not loaded

- Verify that you cannot delete samples that are loaded

- Verify that the study status correctly reflects the state of the study for
  each status.  If mandatory fields (*) are not configured, status should be
  INCOMPLETE.  If there is not at least one fully configured sample (with one
  or more chips) for each experimental condition, the status should be
  INCOMPLETE.  

- Verify that the configuration specifies a array center processing is
  enabled.  (Configure GEOSS, Admin Tools).  If the status of a study
  is COMPLETE, verify that the Place Order button appears.

- Verify that you can place an order if the order status is complete and it
  contains chips not yet associated with an order

- Verify that the array center staff receives an email stating that the order
  needs an order number.

- Verify that additional samples and chips can be added to an already loaded
  study and that a new order can be generated for the new chips.

- Verify that the configuration specifies a array center processing is
  disabled.  If the status of a study is COMPLETE, verify that the Place Order
  button does not appear.

- Verify that you can modify a study which you do not own, but which
  is group writable, and owned by a group you are a member of.

- Verify that "change group" features work. Remember, a study can be
  rw, but some or all of the exp_conditions r- r- - if there is a
  locked order. 

- Verify that studies have the correct ownership/group (under the new
  system of PI ownership -- look directly at the groupref table in the db). 

- Verify that you can delete a study has no data loaded

- Verify that deleting a study removes the exp_conditions and the
  related groupref records.

- Verify that you cannot delete a study that has data loaded.

- Verify that you can View All Studies and sort and search based on columns.

Orders
------
- Verify that you can submit an order on completed studies.

- Verify that curators can assign an order

- Verify that curators can create an order

- Verify that order numbers are assigned in accordance with the configuration
  option selected in "Configure GEOSS"

- Verify that you can view all orders and sort and search based on columns.

- Verify that group and permissions change correctly if you use the
  "change group" feature on an order. This requires a database
  queries.

- Verify that only users with read permission on the order can view it in View
  All Orders

- Verify that order sequence numbers reset appropriately when the year 
  changes (year sequential order numbers only).

- Verify that deleting an order deletes samples and hybridizations,
  and works correctly for zero samples and for zero hybridizations.

- Verify that groupref records are deleted for orders, samples, and
  hybridizations. You'll have to check the order_info.oi_pk,
  sample.smp_pk, and arraymeasurement.am_pk before the delete.

- Verify that curators can delete orders for which data has not been loaded.
  This does NOT delete samples and hybridizations, but should effectively
  "unassign" the order (remove oi_fk from relevant samples)


Loading Data
------------
- Enable "Allow all users to load data" (Configure GEOSS, Admin Tools).
  Verify that users now have a "Load Study" link in Member Home.

- Verify that "Load Study" only presents complete studies that have data to
  load as options for loading.

- Verify that you can upload a study data file.

- Verify that you can load data from the study data file.

- Upload a bad data file (wrong file type, bad hybridization names in the
  header, wrong probe set identifers, wrong # of columns, etc.).  Verify that
  an error is reported and that the data is not loaded.

- Disable "Allow all users to load data"

For curator data load:

- Verify that you can change the directory from which data is read

- Verify that an error is reported if the data is in the wrong format

- Verify that the signal values in am_spots_* match the values from the 
  data file.

- Verify that the log file is in the data owners /var/lib/geoss
  directory. It should be /var/lib/geoss/<user_id>/load_<order_number>.txt
  for example:

      /var/lib/geoss/tdj4m/load_04-30.txt

- Verify the first and last probe set names. These names are in the
  data file, and in the log file
  select signal, spot_identifier from am_spots_mas5, al_spots where als_fk
  = als_pk and am_fk = 57;

- Verify the number of rows of data read. You must count the rows of
  data in the input file, the confirm that this number matches the
  rows read in the log file.

- Verify the number of rows of data inserted into the am_spots_*
  table. First find the am_pk with a SQL query like the following for
  order 02- 22:

- Select am_pk, hybridization_name from arraymeasurement where
  hybridization_name like '02- 22%';

- Plug the appropriate am_pk into this SQL query (we'll use 57 as an
  example):

- Select count(*) from am_spots_mas5 where am_fk=57;

- Verify appropriate values have been loaded for the first and last row of
  data

  hybridizations or use psql.)

- Upload a file of type "other".  Verify that if is uploaded correctly using
  the file viewer.

- Create several criteria files.  Most should contain errors like invalid
  column headers, referring to non-existent hybridizations, and missing
  data.  A couple of the criteria files should have valid syntax.  Upload
  each file type.  Verify that errors are reported for the bad files and
  that the good files are uploaded correctly.  Verify that automatic 
  sets and automatic conditions are created as appropriate.
