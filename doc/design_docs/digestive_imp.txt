1. Add logo and link to site/index.pl. These will be set to values in
    the new organization table. (2 hr)
2. Add new user type "organization_curator". (1 hr)
3. Add a mechanism to indicate whether a user is a digestive center member
  Database:
   Table: Organization
   Fields: 
     org_pk 
     org_name - text
     org_description - text
     org_phone - phone number
     org_url - url
     logo - fi_pk
     display_logo - boolean
     icon - fi_pk # this is the icon that will be displayed beside users of
that group
     chip_discount_percent
     need_approval - boolean

  Table: org_us_link
     org_fk
     us_fk 
     curator - boolean

   When a user is added there will be checkboxes (in the add_user page - 
   parameters for the command line script) for each organization in
  the organization table.  If the checkbox is set, a record is inserted 
  into org_us_link when the user is created. (4 hrs)

4. Modify "Request a new order" to include an additional option that allows
 orders to be optionally associated with an organization.  Only display 
 organizations which the user is a member of.  Allow association with only
 one organization. (1 hr)

5. Modify order creation so that the order needs to be "submitted" once 
 configuration is complete. (4 hrs)

6. If the order is associated with an organization, and that organization
 requires approval (need_approval is true) then the order submittal email
 is sent to all organization curators, otherwise, the submittal email is 
 sent to the GEOSS curator. (4 hrs)

7. An "Organization Home" will be created.  It will contain the following
 links:
    - edit contact info (edit the organization table)
    - edit members
    - approve orders
    - reports
  (8 hrs)

8.  The submittal email (step 6) will contain a link to the "approve orders"
 link in the organization home interface.  This interface will allow 
 organization curators to approve or reject orders.  Approved orders will
 send a submittal email to the GEOSS curator.  
(2 hrs)

9.  The approve order interface will have a comment field.
(n/a)

10.  The billing log will be modified to show whether the order is 
 associated with an organization and to incorporate the appropriate 
 discount for the organization.
(3 hrs)

11. Reports for "Organization Home" will be developed in a later design phase.
(n/a)

Total: 29 hours


Cancer Center Migration
-----------------------
This implementation will allow for migration of cancer center members 
handling to the new "organization" functionality.  This would require
the following:

- convert the existing database (capture cancer center values)
- remove cancer_center_member field from the db, from add_user, and 
  from account.cgi
- insert old value into the new implementation
- test

This is probably and additional 6 hours of work.
