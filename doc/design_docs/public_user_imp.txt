Implementation Document - Public User Functionality

This document is intended to describe an implementation plan for building
public user functionality.  The implementation meets the requirements
outlined in the public user design document.

Public User Creation
--------------------

- add "public" as a user type
- modify geoss_adduser.pl so that users of type public can be created
- modify site/index.html to include links to request an account
- modify configuration table and admintool config editor to include
 an "allow public users" field.  If this option is checked, public
 users can be created.
- modify configuration table and admintool config editor to include
 an "allow member users" field.  If this option is checked, 
  member users can be created.
- modify configuration table and admintool config editor to include a
 "companion installation" field.  This field specifies the url of 
 another GEOSS install.  In the event that this is defined, the following
 logic is applied when accounts are requested:
   - if a public user account is requested, and allow public users is not
     set, send the request to the companion GEOSS
   - if a public user account is requested, and allow public users is 
     set, create the account on the current install
   - if a member account is requested and allow member users is set
     create the account on the current install
   - if a member account is requested and allow public users is set, 
     send the request to the companion GEOSS
- account requests for a member account generate an email to the administrator
- account requests for a public account will create an error if public
   users are not allowed and there is no companion defined.  Otherwise,
   the user will be prompted for a username and an email address.  They 
   will then be emailed a valid password for their account.
- modify the configuration table and admintool config editor to include an 
  "days to confirm activation field" 
- a public user must logon with the amount of time specified in the "days to 
  confirm activation field".  Otherwise their account will be deleted.
- Upon initial login, public users will be required to change their password 
  immediately.
- add last_login field to usersec.  Modify login code to update that field.
- ?? add a cron entry that checks daily for public users to be deleted ??
- public users will be their own PI

Public User Interface
---------------------
- public users see "Member Home"
- links in Member Home are displayed based on user type.  The following 
links will not be available to public users:
     - study and publishing links
     - order links
     - view quality control records
     - curator links

Public Data Sets
----------------
- if a user wants to analyze public data, they need to group data into
  conditions
- a new link (Prepare public data for analysis) will allow the user 
  to select a public data file and group conditions (as if they had 
  downloaded and uploaded the file)
- the public data administrator will need to publish data files to
  companion GEOSS systems

This implementation is the first phase of providing public data for analysis.
Several steps can be automated or made more user friendly.  This will be 
revisited later.  Potentially, we can develop a protocol for GEOSS 
implementations to talk to each other and swap data sets.  However, this 
a large task and beyond the scope of our current work.


User Administration
--------------
- a new link will be added to admintools to allow administrators to view
all users.  The link will contain the user's full name, login, type,
and last login time.
- the header file will be modified to include information on who you are 
logged in as and your user type
