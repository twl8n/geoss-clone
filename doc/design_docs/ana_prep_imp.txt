Implementation Plan - Generic Grouping of Data for Analysis

Overview

This document provides a description of the implementation plan for
building the new analysis grouping component of geoss.  This new
functionality will allow users to prepare data from many sources
for analysis.  The preparations steps will be as similar as possible
given the different forms and origins of the data.   We need to allow
the following kinds of data to be prepared:

- data that was loaded into the database by the BRF
- data (cDNA and mas5) uploaded by the user 
- GEOSS public data

We need to allow data to be grouped in the following ways: 
  - study down
  - hybridization up 
  - based on advanced criteria 
  - detailed definition 
  - single click definition

Each of the above scenarios is described at the conclusion of this
document, and it is illustrated how the described implementation addresses
each requirement.

Implementation Overview:

1.Add new database tables: an_set, an_cond, an_set_cond_link,
  an_cond_am_link 

2.Modify Upload data to support different types of file
  upload (cDNA, mas5, criteria file).  

3.Modify the publish data process.  A criteria file needs to be generated,
  and data and grouping should be made available to all users.  

4.Create new grouping links (from webtools/index).  They will include the 
  following files: create_set.html, create_set.pl, choose_set.html 
  choose_set.pl, edit_set.html, edit_set.pl, add_an_cond_to_set.pl 
  add_an_cond_to_set.html,  create_an_cond.html, create_an_cond.pl, 
  choose_an_cond.pl, choose_an_cond.html, edit_an_cond.pl, 
  edit_an_cond.html,  add_am_to_an_cond.html add_am_to_an_cond.html 

5.Create a new link to "Create an analysis input file" (from webtools/index).
  This link allows an analysis input file to be created from an_set or from 
  public data.  

6.Modify insert_tree.pl to include link to "Create an analysis input file".


Detailed Implementation:

1   Add new database tables: an_set, an_cond, an_set_cond_link,
an_cond_am_link

1.1  Add the following tables:

Table: an_set 
Fields: 
an_set_pk 
an_set_name
an_set_desc 
ans_created

Table: an_cond
Fields: 
an_cond_pk 
an_cond_name 
an_cond_desc 
anc_created

Table: an_set_cond_link
Fields:
an_set_fk
an_cond_fk

Table: 
Fields:
an_cond_am_link
an_cond_fk 
an_hyb_fk

Add the following constraints: 
-  hybridization_name in arraymeasurement must be unique 
-  the combination of an_set_name and ans_created must be unique 
-  the combination of an_cond_name and anc_created must be unique

1.2 Due to the multiple ways that we define sets of conditions, it is
allowable to have sets of conditions with no conditions and conditions
with no hybridizations in the database.  However, when you create an
input file for an analysis, if you specify such a set as input, an error
will be generated.

Discussion:

We need to provide a mechanism to store uploaded chip data and a mechanism
to store new condition groupings.  We decided to put uploaded data into
the existing arraymeasurement and am_spots_* tables and to put groupings
in new an_* tables.  This section explains why we choose that method.

Uploaded Data - We basically saw three options for storing this data:
leave it in the uploaded file, created a new table, or use the existing
hybridization tables.  Although we could have left it in the uploaded file
and extracted it from the file instead of the database when we needed
the information, that opens us up to problems if the file is somehow
deleted when our reference to it is not.  Also, we lose the convenience of
using the database to enforce uniqueness, etc.  Alternatively, we could
have created new tables to load the hybridization information into.
This was deemed unnecessary, as we have an existining infrastructure
to store the data.  The two concerns with this approach are that we
might not be able to tell which data was loaded by users and which data
was loaded by the BRF and that we might not have enough information to
satisfy required fields.  However, we can tell where the data came from
by checking the "smp_fk" field.  BRF data will have a non-null smp_fk.
As for satisifying fields, currently the only NOT NULL field is am_pk,
so we shouldn't run into problems there.  The nice thing about having
the data loaded into the existing tables is that we then have an easy
way to check for uniqueness among hybridization names.

Analysis Groupings - We also want to store various groupings.  We group
hybridizations into analysis conditions and analysis conditions into
sets of conditions.  As these concepts are analagous to studies and
experimental conditions, we considered trying to store these groupings
in those tables.  However, the relationship between hybridizations and
experimental conditions is many-to-one, as is the relationship between
experimental condtions and studies.  This contrasts with the relationship
between hybridizations and analysis conditions which is many-to-many
(as is the relationship between analysis conditions and sets of analysis
conditions).  For that reason, analysis conditions and sets of conditions
are stored in separate tables and linked by link tables.



2   Modify Upload data to support different types of file upload (cDNA,
mas5, criteria file).

2.1 Users can upload files via the "Upload" link.  This page will
be modified so that users can specify the type of file to upload.
The options will include "dChip data file", "mas5 data file", "criteria
file", and "other".

2.2 Other files are uploaded to USER_DATA_DIR/upload/other.

2.3 dChip data files are uploaded to USER_DATA_DIR/upload/dchip.  As part
of the upload, the data is placed in the database.

2.4 mas5 data files are uploaded to USER_DATA_DIR/upload/mas5.  As part
of the upload, the data is placed in the database.

2.5 criteria files are uploaded to USER_DATA_DIR/upload/criteria.
As part of the upload, automatic analysis conditions and sets of
conditions are created.

2.6 The file upload page will be accessible from webtools/index.
Additionally, when a user adds hybridizations to an analysis condition
or adds analysis conditions to a set of conditions, they will have the
option to add from a file.  That option will also access this link.
In addition to providing regular upload functionality, when accessed in
this fashion additional records will be inserted into an_set_cond_link
and/or an an_cond_am_link.  This is described in more detail in the
section on the new grouping links.

2.7  The procedure for loading dChip data files into dChip tables should
be further defined.

2.8 The procedure for loading mas5 data files into mas5 tables should
be further defined.

2.9  A criteria file defines information necessary for grouping
hybridizations.  It links according to hybridization name or analysis
condition name.  Referenced hybridizations must already exist in GEOSS
tables (arraymeasurement).

2.10  The header row is the first line of the criteria file.  Each column
header has the following form:

[tablename::columnname],View[::Categorical][::Continuous][::Condition]

Table Name::Field Name - references the geoss database.  Could be
  arraymeasurement::hybridization_name or an_cond::an_cond_name.

View Name - The name of the value you want the user to see.  For example,
  the view name for arraymeasurement::hybridization_name might be "Name".

Continuous - The user will have the ability to group based on the value in
  this column.  They will see the View Name and be able to set an
  associated comparison operator and a value.  An example of a continuous
  parameter is "age".

Categorical - The user will have the ability to group based on the
  value in this column.  They will see the View Name and be able to select as
  associated values. An example of a continuous parameter is "gender".

Condition - build a condition in an_cond for each distinct value in the
  column.  The condition will be named after the filename/study name and
  view_name and column value.  The file must contain hybridization_names
  for inclusion in the condition.

Set - build a set of conditions in an_set for each distinct value in the
  column.   The set will be named after the filename and view_name and
  column value.  The file must contain condition_names for inclusion in
  the set.

When data is created from a file, the timestamp field is also set.

If the file contains several sets, the an_cond_desc should
read "Created from <filename> as part of set <set>" and the
an_set_desc should read "Created from <filename>.  If the file contains no
set information the an_cond_desc should read "Created from filename".

Female          07-12-2004 12:28:33        "Created from teela_exp2.txt as
part of set 'First Run'"


Note that the condtion names and descriptions can be modified by the user if
they choose.  These are the default values.  If the user specifically sets
the *_desc field in the upload file, that description will be used.


2.11 Criteria files can be used to automatically define analysis
conditions and sets of conditions.  This will occur automatically
when you upload a criteria file.  If the hybridizations does not exist
when the criteria file is uploaded, a warning will be generatedand that
hybridization will not be included in the grouping.  Using the sample file
above (teela_exp1_r2.txt), if hyb_1 was not already in arraymeasurement,
a warning is displayed and no record is inserted into an_cond_am_link
for that hybridiziation..

2.12. If conditions already exist, a warning will be generated.
Conditions will not be overwritten.  Conditions are unique based on 
name and timestamp.

2.13 Criteria files may also be used to support advanced grouping.
Advanced grouping options are displayed based on continuous and
categorical columns.

2.14 View names must be unique.

3   Modify the publish data process.  A criteria file needs to be
generated, and data and grouping should be made available to all users.

3.1 Modify the publish data process to write a criteria file that contains
default grouping.

3.2 Write a function to select public data that will be accessible
from create_set and from the create input file for analysis link.
This function displays all public data files on the system.  If selected,
it will transfer the appropriate information into the users analysis
grouping tables.


4   Create new grouping links (from webtools/index).  They will include
the following files: create_set.html, create_set.pl, choose_set.html
choose_set.pl, edit_set.html, edit_set.pl, add_an_cond_to_set.pl
add_an_cond_to_set.html,  create_an_cond.html, create_an_cond.pl,
choose_an_cond.pl, choose_an_cond.html, edit_an_cond.pl,
edit_an_cond.html,  add_am_to_an_cond.html add_am_to_an_cond.html

4.1 A new section for the preparation of analysis data will be added
to member home.  It will include the following links: 
  - create new set of conditions 
  - edit existing set of conditions 
  - create new analysis conditions 
  - edit existing analysis conditions 
  - create an analysis input file

The current links "Upload a file for analysis", "Edit/Delete/Run an
existing Analysis Tree" and "Create/Run a new Analysis Tree" will also
be included in this section.  The upload link should be renamed to
"Upload a data file".

4.2. Edit Existing X links will take you to a page that allows you to
select which existing set of conditions/analysis conditions you would
like to edit.  Unlike our other choose_* files, we will need to provide
navigational/search options beyond scrolling so that users can quickly
choose the component they would like to edit.  (It is quite possible for
users to have very large numbers of conditions.)  After the component
is selected, the user is taken to the edit_* page for that component.

4.3. Creating new analysis conditions/set of conditions will get the name
and description for the new component.	Then the user will be taken to
the corresponding edit_* page for that component.  Optionally, the user
can create based on a study/exp_condition that is already defined in
the database.  If they choose that option, the grouping is copied from
the study/exp_condition tables.

4.2 edit_set: This page allows the user to specify the following: 
 - Name: (writes to an_set_name) 
 - Description: (writes to an_set_desc) 
 - a list of an_conditions
    - each condition has an edit button and a delete button associated
    with it

4.2.1 Removing a condition removes a record from an_set_cond_link

4.2.2 Editing a condition takes you to "edit_condition" for that condition

4.2.3 There is a button to add condition(s) to the set.  It takes the
user to add_an_conds_to_set.

4.2.3.1 Each condition that is added results in a new entry in the
an_set_cond_link table.

4.2.3.2 Conditions can be added in the following ways:
   - choosing individual pre-existing analysis conditions (already defined
   in an_cond) 
   - choosing individual pre-existing experimental conditions
   (already defined in exp_cond) 
   - choosing a set of pre-existing conditions based on criteria (advanced grouping).  By default,we should support choosing by name or by study.  By name allows a pattern match on a name.  By study will choose all exp_conditions with the same sty_fk, or all an_conds associated with a specific an_set.  Users should
also have the option of uploading a criteria file.
   - choosing conditions from a file.  This takes the user to a version of
the upload page that allows uploading data files (mas5 or dChip) and an
associated criteria file (grouping). Data is loaded and grouped based
on the files.  Because we are accessing this from add conditions to a
set of conditions all conditions in the file are associated with the
set of conditions that is currently being editted regardless of ::set
and ::condition values.

4.3 edit_an_cond: This page allows the user to specify the following: 
  - Name: (writes to an_cond_name) 
  - Description: (writes to an_cond_desc)
  - a list of hybridizations

4.3.1  Each hybridization has a delete button associated with it

4.3.2  Removing a hybridization removes a record from an_cond_am_link

4.3.3 There is a button to add hybridization(s) to the set.
  - each hybridization that is added results in a new entry in the
  an_cond_am_link table.
  - hybridizations can be added in the following ways:
  - choosing individual pre-existing analysis hybridizations (already
  defined in arraymeasurement) 
  - choosing a set of pre-existing hybridizations based on criteria 
    (advanced grouping).  By default, we should support choosing by 
    name or by study or by condition.  By name allows a pattern  
    match on a name.  By study will choose all arraymeasurement 
    records associated  with the same sty_fk or set of conditions.  
    By condition will choose all arraymeasurement records associated 
    with a specific an_cond or exp_condition. Users should also have 
    the option of uploading a criteria file for additional criteria.
   - choosing hybridizations from a file.  This takes the user to a
   version of the upload page that allows uploading data files 
   (mas5 or dChip) and an associated criteria file (grouping). Data 
   is loaded and grouped based on the files.  Because we are accessing 
   this from add hybridizations to a condition all hybridizations in the 
   file are associated with the conditions that is currently being 
   editted regardless of ::set and ::condition values.

5.  Create a new link to "Create an analysis input file" (from
webtools/index).  This link allows an analysis input file to be created
from an_set or from public data.

5.1 Add a new link from webtools/index to create_an_fi.pl.

5.2 Create create_an_fi.pl and create_an_fi.html.  This page allows the
user to specify the following: 
 - filename
 -  comments 
 - Data Source - an_set, study, public_study

5.3 If the data source is an_set, data is written to the file as described
in the set definition.	A record describing the file is inserted into
fileinfo.  use_as_input is set to true.  The conditions and condsLabels
are set according to set definition.

5.4 If the data source is a study, corresponding an_set and an_cond
records are created.  Data is then extracted as above.

5.5 If the data source is a public study, the appropriate files can be
"uploaded" from the public data directory.  The default grouping can
be created and the records can be inserted into the analysis tables for
that user.  Then the data can be pulled out into a file.  This involves
considerable data duplication.	Eventually we would like to modify this
so data is stored only once and each user can create their own grouping.
That is scheduled for later development.

5.6 If the user chooses a filename that is already in use, a warning will
be generate.  They may be given an option to overwrite the file (if it
is not currently in use) or they will be asked to choose a new name.

5.7 A warning should be generated if we are unable to determine that
all chips have the same chip type.

5.8 An error should occur if any of the the user tries to create a
file with a grouping that contains 0 conditions or a condition with
0 hybridizations.

5.9 When a file is created based on an an_set, timestamps are not included in
the condsLabels.  If this means this results in duplicate condition names,
the file is still created, but a warning will be returned.

5.10 Individual analyses should return an error prior to running if duplicate
conditions names are a problem (Bug 343).

5.11 When a file is created, a log file is also created (similar to the current
extract) that contains unambiguous information regarding which condition was
used.



6    Modify insert_tree.pl to include link to "Create an analysis
input file".

6.1 Insert_tree will now allow the user to specify an input file (current
functionality) or alternatively to create a new analysis input file.
If they choose to create a new file, at the completion of creating the
file, they will be returned to insert_tree and the new file they have
just created will be set as the input for the tree are creating.


Summary - How this Implementation Satisfies Requirements

Data that was loaded into the database by the BRF User can go straight to
"Create an Analysis Input File" and select the appropriate study.

data (cDNA and mas5) uploaded by the user Users go to the upload link.
They specify the necessary files and data type.  If they specify an
associated criteria file, analysis conditions and sets of conditions can
be created automatically when the files are uploaded.  Alternatively,
they can manually specify the grouping using the grouping links.

GEOSS public data The "Create an Analysis Input File" link will allow the
user to choose their own data or one of the public data sets to create
the input file from.  If they choose a public data set, they will get the
default grouping of the public data.  If they wish to change the default
grouping, they can create their own grouping, using the grouping links
and then extract to a file.

study down Study down grouping implies that the user thinks of defining
their groupin in the following order: set of conditions, conditions,
hybridizations.  This can be accomplished via the grouping links.
Users can first create a set of conditions, click on add conditions,
add each condition and then click on add hybridizations (which can be
added by uploading data at this point if required) within each condition.

hybridization up Hybridization up grouping implies that the user thinks
of defining their grouping in the following order: hybridizations,
conditions, set of conditions.	This can be accomplished via the grouping
links.	First the user can create hybridizations (via the upload link).
Then they can create conditions and add the existing hybridizations.
Then they can create a set of conditions and add the existing analysis
conditions.

based on advanced criteria Advanced criteria means the user wants to
group hybridizations in conditions or sets of conditions into conditions
based on certain data associated hybridizations (or analysis conditions).
That data may be criteria such as age or gender.  To do this, users must
supply a criteria file that links the data with existing hybridizations.
They can then select "Advanced Grouping" when adding components, which
will allow them to add components based on the criteria file.

detailed definition Detailed definition means that certain researchers
require the ability to fine tune their grouping to the point of removing
hybridizations from one analysis condition and adding them to a different
one.  This functionality is provided via the grouping links.

single click definition Single click definition means that researchers
shouldn't have to define their grouping in a detailed fashion if the
grouping is already defined in the database or in a file.  They should
be able to basically say "use this grouping" and create the analysis
file.  Traditionally, this requirement has conflicted with the detailed
definition requirement.  With this implementation, researchers will be
able to get database initiated grouping in one click, because the grouping
can be transferred to the analysis tables at the study or exp_condition
level with a single click.  Public data grouping will also be single
click as we will now export the grouping along with the public data.
For users who upload data from a file, they can specify the grouping
in their criteria file if they choose, so they do not have to group via
the grouping links.
