Bulk Loading of GEOSS data

Objectives:
-----------

To provide a mechanism for loading information into the
GEOSS database that is quicker than the current GUI mechanism.

1. Allow an upload of a known-state test database to facilitate testing.

2. Provide a quick mechanisim to upload historical data for users who 
   install GEOSS.

3. Provide an interface for loading multiple orders for which data is
   available, without requiring array center staff users to navigate
   through each order in curtools.


Tools:
------
1. Add a command-line tool (geoss_bulk_load) for bulk load of data.  
This tool expects all configuration to be in place (i.e. study defined,
order created, and data in chip_data_path).  It checks existing locked
(submitted) orders and checks the chip data path to see if the
appropriate files to load are present.  This tool should allow both
interactive and force modes.  Interactive mode will find the order then
ask whether or not to load the order.  Force mode will automatically
load all available orders.

2.  Add a GUI interface to geoss_bulk_load so that it is available to
array center staff via the GEOSS GUI.

3.  Add a command-line tool (geoss_bulk_configurator) which configures
study/order information.  The configuration is based on a set of input
data and configuration files.  The tools should have a read-only mode 
that states what will be created if the tool is run and error checks the
input.  The tools should also have a flag to inhibit locking of orders
so that configuration can be viewed and modified through the GUI if
necessary.  The default behaviour will be to lock the orders so that
they are ready for data load. 

4.  Users should be able to run geoss_bulk_configurator and
geoss_bulk_load in combination to load all data.

5.  Add a tool to create mutliple geoss user accounts
(geoss_bulk_adduser).

Assumptions
------------
1.  The tools will handle the mas5 and gcos data formats.

2.  The configurator assumes a 1-to-1 relationship between array studies
and array orders.  This is reasonable as a bulk configuration implies
the loading of historical data, for which the order step has long since
been complete.   


Steps to Load Historical Data
-----------------------------
1.  Add all users using geoss_bulk_adduser.

2. Create a directory that contains all data for bulk load.  Make
one subdirectory named with the userid of each user who owns data.
Within an individual user subdirectory, create a subdirectory for each 
order/study.  The name of the subdirectory will become the name of the
array study. Note that the bulk load expects a 1-to-1 relationship
between orders and studies.  

3.  For each study, move the corresponding data files into that
directory.  Files must be renamed to the following format:

[order_#]_<exp. cond. short name>_<bio. replicate letter>[_chip replicate #]

Order # - this is optional.  If an unused order_number in appropriate 
GEOSS format is specified, then it will be used.  If no order number is
specified, one will be automatically generated.

Exp. cond. short name - this name must be six or fewer characters.

Bio. replicate letter - this is a sequence of letters used to indicate
 biological replicates.  If you have only one sample, with the short
 name of samp1, then it would be named samp1_A.  If you had two samples
 from the same experimental condition, then they would be named samp1_A
 and samp1_B.

Chip replicate # - this is a sequence of numbers used to indicate chip
replicates.  If you had two chip replicates for each of the samples
mentioned above, then your data files would be named "samp1_A_1",
"samp1_A_2", "samp1_B_1", and "samp1_B_2".

There must be a txt file and an RPT file for each hybridization.

4.  Optional txt files containing additional information may be placed 
in the study subdirectory.  Txt files should be named after the table
they contain data for (valid tables include study, exp_condition, and
sample).  Columns should be tab-delimited.  Sample txt files are shown here:

study.txt
sty_comments  this is a bulk load study

exp_condition.txt
samp1  description  This is the description
samp2  name  Long name sample 2
samp2  description   This is the second description

sample.txt
samp1_A_1   smp_name  24hr
samp1_A_2   smp_name  24hrb

These txt files will provide the ability to load associated data that
makes GEOSS a more useful data archive.  This information is not
required to be able to load data or to run analysis on data.

5. Run geoss_bulk_configurator in read-only mode.  Correct any errors it
reports.

6. Run geoss_bulk_configurator.

7. Run geoss_bulk_data_load.
