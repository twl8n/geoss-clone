This is a brief description of the site style guide.

-------
General

We don't use H1, etc (heading) tags. These render in bizarre (usually
very large) text in may browsers. Instead major headings are bold, +1
size. Minor headings are bold.

All the text and images in main documentation pages is in a single
table row. Multiple table rows are a headache to
maintain. Intra-paragraph spacing is left to the browser defaults and
done with paragraphs (not breaks). Table rows will mess up the
paragraph spacing.

We are using italics for "command line user name" prompt
identification. The actual command is bold.

Transcripts are <pre>.

We are not using colored horizontal rules (<hr>). It may not be well
supported, and it is a headache to maintain.


---------------
Page properties
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" topmargin="0"
  leftmargin="0" link="#006633" vlink="#666633">

Link colors are web-safe colors which are close to the logo colors.

Margin height and width are often zero as well, but I'm not 
sure what effect that has, and many pages leave these to the browser
default. 


---------------
Main page table
600 pixels wide, zero border, zero cellpadding, zero cellspacing

Column 1 is the left color bar, and it goes all the way to the top of
the page. This was done to avoid the necessity of cellpadding in the
main table. Instead column 2 of the main table serves as a
gutter. Cellpadding causes problems.

column 1: 10 pixels
column 2: 10 pixels
column 3: 580 pixels

Columns 1 and 1 are bottom aligned. 

Columns 1 and 2 are held to their correct size with a 10x10 white gif
(at the bottom where it isn't a visual problem).


----------
Logo table
The logo table is now inside the main table.

The logo table is often 2 columns, but this isn't very
consistent. Ideally the logo table is 3 columns. Table size is
100%. Zero border etc.
column 1: smaller than the logo, and the logo pushes it out
column 2: smaller than 10 pixels (the table is in percent), and uses
white.gif at 10x10 to push it out to 10 pixels (visually consistent
wit the color bars and gutter).
column 3: size doesn't matter, use the remainder

Logo table text is: <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
size="+1">


------
Colors

The logo is a jpg, and aliasing and lossy compression create some
extra colors, but in general the colors are:

light green: c9dfae
dark green: 85a25f
purple: 80007e


Install guide medium red: db003b

Admin pages dark red: 7c0000
