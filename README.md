# geoss-clone
Clone of the most recent version of GEOSS, originally from Sourceforge.

There is some interesting Perl code in this project, especially code to display a tree in HTML using graphics tiles.

This was GEOSS 2.6.1. Development on the original stopped when funding ran out. I'm one of the original authors.
